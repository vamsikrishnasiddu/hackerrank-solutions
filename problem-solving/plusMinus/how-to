I need three variables countPos countNeg countZero  

I will store the len of arr in a variable called length

I will store the results of these variables in an array and i will loop over the array and print the values.


The challenge here is to print up to six decimal places i got the logic 

fmt.Printf("%.6f",num)


What you need to learn:

I thought append will just replace the elements with whatever we provide but it will add

at the end of the array.

Need more learnings on arrays and slices.

Need learnings on formatting output for decimal places.
